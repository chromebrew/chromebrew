## Overview

Chromebooks with ChromeOS run a Linux kernel. The only missing pieces to use them as full-featured Linux distro were gcc and make with their dependencies. Well, these pieces aren't missing anymore. Say hello to Chromebrew!

## Prerequisites

You will need a Chromebook with developer mode enabled. To do so, select your device on [the ChromiumOS Wiki](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-information-for-chrome-os-devices) and follow the instructions listed there.

> [!WARNING]
> Please be aware of the fact that developer mode is insecure if not properly configured.

<a id="set_passwd" /> <!-- for reference in installation section -->
> [!TIP]
> Setting a password as instructed in the VT-2 login screen is recommended. It is also recommended to enable signed boot:
>
> ```bash
> sudo chromeos-setdevpasswd
> sudo crossystem dev_boot_signed_only=1
> ```

## Supported Systems

| Architecture | Supported? |
|:------------:|:----------:|
| x86_64       | Yes        |
| i686         | Yes\*      |
| armv7l       | Yes        |
| aarch64      | Yes        |

\* _We can only provide limited support for i686 since Google has discontinued support. Although we can no longer support GUI apps, we will try to continue to support CLI programs._

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The beta, dev, and Canary channels are ***not*** supported and should ***not*** be used with Chromebrew. Failure to take notice of this warning will cause major issues with your Chromebrew installation.
>
> See issue [#2890](https://github.com/chromebrew/chromebrew/issues/2890) and the [FAQ](https://github.com/chromebrew/chromebrew/wiki/FAQ) for more details.

> [!WARNING]
> On ChromeOS M117+, the Chromebrew installer will not work in `crosh` anymore due to the security changes introduced in ChromeOS M117.

Open a VT-2 terminal session with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>-></kbd> and login with the `chronos` user and password if set [above](#set_passwd). *(if you are unable to do this, please have a second look at the prerequisites and make sure your Chromebook is in developer mode)*

Then run the installation script below:

```bash
bash <(curl -L git.io/vddgY) && . ~/.bashrc
```
