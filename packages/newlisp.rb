  def self.build
    # This works but readline and ffi are disabled. When using the
    #  standard ./configure it's looking in the wrong place for ffi.h
    #  and readline isn't linked against libtermcap/ncurses.
    #
    # Looks like the readline issue is the system libreadline vs the
    #  one shipped with bash.
    #
    # Ideally I'll figure out how to get it building properly as follows:
    # system "./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-readline --enable-ffi"
    system "./configure-alt --prefix=/usr/local"
    system "make"
    system "make", "check"
  end

    system "make", "DESTDIR=#{CREW_DEST_DIR}", "install"
  end
