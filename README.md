Overview
--------

Chromebooks with Chrome OS run a Linux kernel. The only missing pieces to use them as full-featured Linux distro were gcc and make with their dependencies. Well, these pieces aren't missing anymore. Say hello to Chromebrew!

Prerequisites
-------------

You will need a Chromebook with developer mode enabled.  To do so, select your device on
[the ChromiumOS Wiki](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-information-for-chrome-os-devices) and follow the instructions listed there.

Please be aware of the fact that developer mode is insecure if not properly configured. Setting a password as instructed in the VT-2 login screen is essential. It is also recommended to enable signed boot:

```bash
sudo chromeos-setdevpasswd
sudo crossystem dev_boot_signed_only=1
```

Supported Systems
-----------------

| Architecture | Supported? |
|:---:|:---:|
| x86_64 | Yes |
| i686 | Yes<sup>*</sup> |
| armv7l | Yes |
| aarch64 | Yes |

<sup>*</sup> <em>We can only provide limited support for i686 since Google has discontinued support.  Although we can no longer support gui apps, we will try to continue to support cli programs.</em>

Installation
------------

The beta, dev, and Canary channels are ***not*** supported and should ***not*** be used with Chromebrew.
Failure to take notice of this will cause major issues with your Chromebrew installation.
See issue [#2890](https://github.com/skycocker/chromebrew/issues/2890) and the [FAQ](https://github.com/skycocker/chromebrew/wiki/FAQ) for more details.

Open the terminal with Ctrl+Alt+T and type `shell`.

If this command returns `ERROR: unknown command: shell`, please have a second look at the prerequisites and make sure your Chromebook is in developer mode.

Then download and run the installation script below:

    curl -Ls git.io/vddgY | bash

On a rooted Google OnHub, the command needs to be run with the "chronos" user. In order to make su work, a password is needed for the chronos user.

    # passwd chronos
    Changing password for chronos.
    Enter new UNIX password:
    Retype new UNIX password:
    # su - chronos
    Password:
    $ curl -Ls git.io/vddgY | bash
