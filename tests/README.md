## Preparing tests

To prepare a test, copy crew compatible `.rb` package(s) to this directory.

## Running tests

Execute `ruby test_all`

It should finish normally if the tests passed, and end with `exit 1` otherwise; preferably explaining why the tests failed.

Running tests manually may not work!
